        <p>"I will rate this a four because I made changes... but with my changes I would rate it a 5!! The changes I made were 2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp vanilla and half a bag of chocolate chips. So yummy! I made this in my belgian waffle maker and they turned our wonderful! I served this with Easy Whipped Cream from this site. I made the leftovers and froze them. I think I will try them for dessert with ice cream next!"</p>
